## Job Description: Computer Vision Deep Learning Engineer
### Position Overview
We are seeking an experienced **Computer Vision & Deep Learning Engineer** to drive development of multimodal imaging algorithms at **PrediX**, a precision‑oncology startup building an AI‑driven “virtual biopsy” using radiology and digital pathology. You will join a small, high‑impact R&D team to research, develop, and deploy SOTA models for multimodal learning and retrieval.

**Location:** Ramat‑Gan (Hybrid)

**Department:** R&D

**Reports to:** CTO

**Start date:** Immediate

## Key Responsibilities

### Hands‑On Research and Development
- Design, develop, and optimize multimodal (MRI/CT-WSI) models: contrastive learning, representation learning, and retrieval.
- Build segmentation and ROI pipelines for radiology and digital pathology data (preprocessing, normalization, and quality control).
- Run controlled experiments, fine‑tune foundation backbones, analyze errors, and improve robustness and generalization.
- Establish clear metrics and benchmarks, build evaluation suites and dashboards.

## Qualifications
### Educational Background
- M.Sc. or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Electrical/Biomedical Engineering, Data Science, or related field with focus on computer vision / deep learning.

### Experience
- 3+ years hands‑on developing and shipping deep learning models (medical imaging preferred).
- Track record in high‑impact computer vision projects. 
- Familiarity with regulated environments is a plus.

### Technical Skills
- Strong PyTorch experience with CNN/ViT/transformer architectures and segmentation.
- Hands-on experience and ability to develop new models for contrastive/self‑supervised learning, retrieval systems, and evaluation.
- Innovative ability to design and scale practical data pipelines for medical imaging is advantageous.
- Solid engineering: Python (C++ nice‑to‑have), version control, containers, cloud infrastructure (AWS or similar), and basic MLOps.

### Soft Skills
- Team player with excellent collaboration skills.
- Strong problem‑solving and ownership.
- Clear written/oral communication.
